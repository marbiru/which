# which
Which of these websites has higher traffic? A little quiz programme showing how far off our intuitions tend to be

## some notes

+ I think many of us don't know how big certain websites outside our own particular demographic are; this is just a little quiz-programme that shows us that. Presents the user with two options and asks them which is bigger (based on Alexa rankings) and then tells the user if she got the answer right.
+ programme needs to be renamed, hopefully snappilly
